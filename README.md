# VulkanRenderer

This project is a real time 3D renderer made with Vulkan.
It also uses GLFW and GLM libraries for windows creation and linear algebra.
It load 3D Model using tinyobjloader library.

# Warning

This project is still WIP, the current features are not available :
- Antialliasing
- Shading
- Camera movements (instead the model will rotate on himself)

Also, the content may not be properly commented or structured yet since I am doing this project for educational purpose to learn Vulkan.
